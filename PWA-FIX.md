# PWA Installation Fix - Service Worker Added

## What Changed

Your PWA wasn't installing properly because Chrome requires a service worker for true PWA installation. I've added:

1. **Service Worker** (`public/sw.js`)
   - Enables offline functionality
   - Caches essential files
   - Network-first strategy with cache fallback

2. **Service Worker Registration** (in `app.js`)
   - Automatically registers on page load
   - Logs success/failure to console

## How to Test the Fix

### On Android:

1. **Clear Chrome data for your site**:
   - Chrome menu → Settings → Site settings
   - Find your domain → Clear & reset
   - OR: Long press the shortcut → App info → Clear data

2. **Visit your site fresh**:
   - Open Chrome
   - Navigate to your app
   - Wait a few seconds for service worker to register

3. **Install as PWA**:
   - Look for install banner OR
   - Chrome menu → "Install app" (not "Add to Home screen")
   - The option should now say "Install" instead of "Add to Home screen"

4. **Verify proper installation**:
   - App opens without Chrome UI
   - No Chrome badge on icon
   - Shows in Android app drawer
   - Can be managed like a regular app

## Troubleshooting

**Still showing as shortcut?**
- Check Developer Tools → Application → Service Workers (on desktop)
- Ensure HTTPS is being used
- Try incognito mode to rule out cache issues
- On Android: Settings → Apps → Chrome → Storage → Clear cache

**Service Worker not registering?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `/sw.js` is accessible (visit directly)
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled

## What You Get Now

✅ **True PWA installation** - No Chrome badge  
✅ **Offline support** - Basic caching of visited pages  
✅ **App management** - Shows in Android app settings  
✅ **Background updates** - Service worker can update cache  
✅ **Install prompts** - Chrome will show install banners  

The service worker is minimal but fully functional. It caches pages as you visit them and serves from cache when offline.
