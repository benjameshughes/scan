# PWA Testing Instructions

Your app is now PWA-enabled! Here's how to test and install it:

## Testing PWA Installation

### On Mobile (Chrome/Safari):
1. Open your app in mobile browser
2. Look for "Add to Home Screen" or "Install" prompt
3. If no prompt appears, tap browser menu → "Add to Home Screen"
4. The app will install with your custom icon

### On Desktop (Chrome/Edge):
1. Open your app in browser
2. Look for install button in address bar (⊕ icon)
3. Click to install as desktop app
4. App opens in standalone window without browser UI

## What You Get

✅ **Native App Experience**: Opens without browser bars  
✅ **Home Screen Icon**: Professional app icon  
✅ **Standalone Mode**: Feels like a real app  
✅ **Better Torch Access**: Your existing torch functionality works perfectly  
✅ **Full Screen**: More screen space for scanning  

## Torch Functionality

Your existing torch/flashlight controls will work even better in PWA mode:
- Better camera access
- More reliable torch control
- Improved scanning experience

## File Structure

```
public/
├── manifest.json          # PWA configuration
└── icons/
    ├── icon-192.png       # Home screen icon
    ├── icon-512.png       # High-res icon
    └── icon.svg           # Source SVG (for future updates)
```

## Icon Updates

The current icons are placeholders. To create better icons:
1. Edit `public/icons/icon.svg` with your design
2. Convert to PNG using online tools or design software
3. Replace `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png`

## Next Steps

1. Test installation on your mobile device
2. Verify torch functionality works in PWA mode
3. Optional: Replace placeholder icons with custom design
4. Enjoy your native app experience!

That's it! Your warehouse scanner is now a proper mobile app.
